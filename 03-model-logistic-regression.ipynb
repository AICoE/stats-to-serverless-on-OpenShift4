    "## Dealing with Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the training data set contains unequal representation from each of your classes we say we are dealing with _imbalanced classes_. In our data set only approximately 2% of the samples are fraudulent, and the remaining 98% are legitimate. Thus we have imbalanced classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This causes problems for a few reasons:\n",
    "1. a model which classified all new transactions as 'legitimate' would be correct 98% of the time. This high accuracy can trick you into thinking that your model is working well, despite it just returning 'legitimate' for every sample it sees. \n",
    "2. even if your model tries to learn patterns in the data, it may struggle to learn frmo the 'fraudulent' data since there simply isn't enough of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are afew approaches we could take to tackling the problem, but the two we are going to use today are: \n",
    "1. use metrics which are more informative that if we just counted how many times the model makes a correct classification. \n",
    "2. weight the samples by the inverse of the frequency of their label. These weights will be passed into the logistic regression model, and used to ensure that the model is penalized proportionally to this weight for making a missclassification when it is training. \n",
